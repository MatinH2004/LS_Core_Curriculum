# Working With HTTP - Lesson Summary

- HTTP is a text-based protocol. HTTP Request and Responses involve sending text between the client and server

- In order for the protocol to work, the Request and Response must be structured in such a way that both the client and the server can understand them.

- With HTTP/1.1, the end of the headers is indicated by an empty line.

- The Content-Length header can be used to indicate the size of the body. This can help determine where the HTTP message should end.
