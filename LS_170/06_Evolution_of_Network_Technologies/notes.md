# Summary

- HTTP has changed considerably over the years, and is continuing to change.

- Many of the changes to HTTP are focused on improving performance in response to the ever increasing demands of modern networked applications.

- Latency has a big impact on the performance of networked applications. As developers and software engineers we need to be aware of this impact, and try to mitigate against it through the use of various optimizations.

- In building networked applications, there are tools and techniques available to us that work around or go beyond the limitations of basic HTTP request-response functionality.

- For certain use cases a peer-to-peer architecture may be more appropriate than a client-server architecture.
