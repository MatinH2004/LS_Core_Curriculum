# Create an empty class named `Cat`

class class 
end

# Defining a class is similar to defining a method, except for two notable differences:

#  - When defining a class, the reserved word class is used instead of def.
#  - When naming a class, the CamelCase format is used instead of the snake_case format.

# Classes, like methods, also use the reserved word end to finish the definition.
