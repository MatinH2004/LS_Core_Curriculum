            Welcome to Twenty-One!

  This game is a simplified version of Blackjack,
  where your only options are to 'Hit' or 'Stay'!

  Choosing to 'Hit' will mean you get dealt another 
  card, while choosing to 'Stay' will end your turn 
  and begin the dealer's turn!

  The goal of the game is to get a total card value 
  of 21 or as close to it as possible.

  If you exceed 21, this is called a bust, and the 
  dealer will automatically win!

  If you get 21 exactly, you hit Blackjack and win! 
  However, if the dealer also hits Blackjack then 
  you both tie.

  Otherwise, the person to get as close to 21 as 
  possible after both turns, wins!

  You and the dealer will both be dealt two cards 
  at the beginning of the game, with both of your 
  cards appearing face up, and the dealer's cards 
  having one face up and the other facedown. 

  At the beginning of the dealer's turn, they will 
  flip over their unknown card.

  At the end of the dealer's turn, both player's card 
  totals will be calculated and the round winner will 
  be announced! First player to 5 wins is the grand
  winner!
